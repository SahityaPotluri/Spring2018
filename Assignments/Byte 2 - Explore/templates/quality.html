	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p><font size = "4.5"> The dataset is collected from the 
		<a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283796.html">ESPN CricInfo</a>
		website, which is in an authentic source of information pertaining to Cricket. The ESPN makes sure to update
		the statistics frequently. This particular dataset was updated as recent as 9/9/2018. Hence the analysis we derive
		on this dataset would be coherent with the current world.</font></p>

	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<!--<p>If not, what is missing and what concerns does it raise?

	What is your evidence for this?</p>-->
	<p><font size = "4.5">Yes, the data is complete. 
	It does not have any missing valued entries and is also upto date. This data can answer the questions I attempt
	to answer, like 'Which wicket keeper has scored the highest number of dismissals in his career?' or 'Which player
	scored the largest number of catch dismissals?'</font></p>

	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<!--<p>Does it make sense relative to itself? Does it match your
	expectations? Are the distributions sensible? What is your
	evidence for this?</p>-->
	<p><font size = "4.5">Yes, the data is coherent. The number of dismissals acquired by a wicket keeper should be the
	sum of the dismissals via catches and stumpings. I found that sum of the catches and stumpings match
	with  dismissals across all the players. I also
	verified that the type of values under each column is consistent with the expected type i.e. 
the Player column should comprise of strings, Span column should comprise the pattern 
	{(year)-(year|Present)} like (1988-2012) or (1988-Present),
	and the other columns should comprise of integer values.</font></p>

	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<!--<p>What aspects of this data can you verify? How did you do so? What did
	you find?</p>-->
	<p><font size = "4.5">Yes. The data is correct. I verified this from three factors: 1) The entries in the dataset do not require a subjective evaluation, thereby reducing 
	human bias or error 2) ESPN updates the data frequently and is a well know credible organization 3) I also cross-verified the values of top 20 entries with the values from Wikipedia
	and other cricket information related websites.</font></p>
